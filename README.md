Just keeping track of what I'm learning.

Today's quote: "Give me a place to stand and I can move the world." -Archimedes

What I'm doing:
Got to the 55% mark on Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals. I like how he explains things and gets into the details. I hate not knowing what a line of code does.  I'm going a little slower to build a solid foundation. I'm working through his Github-battle app which is fun. I'm going to make a React app of my own.

I still didn't feel solid on "this" keyword but it was late so I hopped over to Fun Fun Functions to look at some of his videos. Something fun before sleep.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhbhD1HR5vk

Browsed in codepen.  This is cool: https://codepen.io/nikita_ska/pen/JOExqEi

Goal: Get really good at React

Goal: to find a cool place to work where NO ONE eats Soylent.

Working as a sub today.
Plan: review yesterday's learning and complete next section: Stateless Functional Components.

Challenge: create a simple react app and deploy to Heroku Projects/react-projects/react-play.

Teaching all day. Science classes in which the kids were dissecting owl pellets.  Fun times (really). Anyway I met up with someone from the cohort to study and he said that the lecture on React was about an hour long and just a puff piece about how great it is (which is true). When people asked for a demo/code along the instructor did a simple example but admitted that he had taught himself the night before. According to my source the majority of students' questions were answered with 'I don't know' or 'I'll have to look it up.' I can look things up and learn on my own. Why do I need to pay 176+$/day for that? Also there was a brief lecture on Redux but students were told that they weren't expected to know it.

So I'm glad I quit the program. They should definitely think that it's a vote of no confidence when a student in good standing quits. Yes, I struggled to keep up but I did it. I'm kicking myself that I didn't wait for the cohort taught by the other instructor. Totally different environment.

I've been feeling like a loser for quitting but what was I quitting anyway? I'm still learning to code so I'm not quitting that. What I quit was a program that wasn't getting me where I wanted to be. I have a strong need to understand and be good at what I do.

Tara flat out said that my cohort was clique-ish unlike other cohorts. My perception was that there were some people who definitely felt threatened by the idea of a 50+ mother being a peer. "You mean we have to treat them like people?!??". These tended to be the  men in their thirties and forties.  But I would say that the majority of people were afraid of being judged and isolated into smaller self-similar groups and it wasn't intentional. the chronic rhetoric of "grit" created a sink or swim atmosphere. People revert to thinking in stereotypes. Definitely only a few people didn't think about me in terms of stereotypes or bother to check to see if I fulfilled those stereotypes. There were members and students outside my cohort who treated me like a peer but within my own cohort... woefully insufficient camaraderie. but enough analysis. My goal is to keep Github green.

11/18/17 Hurrah! An entire week off to do as I please...although I still have to make Thanksgiving happen. Yup, I'm Emotional Laborer in Chief.

11/24/17  Meh... I did not get as much done as I wanted to! But that's the way it is during a holiday. I've resolved that when I'm in a situation that I'm being interrupted that I'll just work on reviewing basics like html, css and javascript. Stuff that it doesn't matter if I have to set it aside for a bit. I did my first run thru' of react router unit. I'll go over it again tomorrow but for now I'm done.
